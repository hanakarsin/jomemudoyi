Nxivm, which masqueraded as a self-improvement workshop, was created to lure young, sometimes underage female professionals. <a href=#>Founded by Raniere</a> and Nancy Salzman in the late '90s, the MLM company was finally brought down by an expos√© published by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> in October 2017.</p><p>This led to an official federal investigation that unveiled Keith's despicable (and downright evil) actions and behavior and also revealed the shocking role Smallville actress Allison Mack played in the cult's operations. Here are all of the known details on the case as they currently stand.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The NYT article, titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Inside a Secretive Group Where Women Are Branded,"</a> uncovered the truth about Keith and how he forced young women into becoming his "sex slaves." They were physically branded with a cauterizing device, starved, raped, and encouraged to recruit other "slaves."</p><p>The women were all instructed to call Keith their "master." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allison was allegedly one of the ringleaders</a> who helped Keith run his whole operation. In 2019, she pled guilty to sex trafficking. ‚ÄúI believed Keith Raniere‚Äôs intentions were to help people, and I was wrong,‚Äù she said during the court hearing, per AP.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What's Allison Mack's sentencing date? New details have emerged.</h2><p>As of now, Allison's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sentencing date</a> has been set for June 30, 2021, but things might change. After Keith was arrested in early 2018, Allison was also charged with sex trafficking and forced labor, and a $5 million bond was set.</p><p>Her sentencing was originally scheduled to be in September 2019, but movement on the case was pushed back ‚Äúto allow time to complete pre-sentencing reports‚Äù and so that the ringleader could be released on bond under strict rules.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Breaking News: Keith Raniere, the Nxivm cult leader, was sentenced to life in prison after his victims gave wrenching testimony about how he sexually abused them. <a href=#>https://t.co/mYjDFdF2Ra</a></p>‚Äî The New York Times (@nytimes) <a href=#>October 27, 2020</a></figure><p>It also appears that Allison is facing additional legal consequences for her actions. Per Entertainment Tonight, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a new lawsuit</a> was brought against the star in January 2020 claiming that she, along with Keith and 13 other people, "exerted power over the plaintiffs; took their money; made it financially, physically and psychologically difficult, and in some cases impossible, to leave the coercive community; and systematically abused plaintiffs physically and emotionally."&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these mounting legal issues, there has been a light at the end of the tunnel somewhat for Allison, who might face a lighter sentence now thanks to her cooperation with federal officers. Indeed, officials filed a document on June 21, 2021, recommending that Allison receives a lighter sentence for cooperating with officers, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>.</p><p>"Although Mack could have provided even more substantial assistance had she made the decision to cooperate earlier, Mack provided significant, detailed, and highly corroborated information which assisted the government in its prosecution," the statement read.</p><p>This doesn't change the fact that the former actress is still likely facing a conviction come June 30, but it significantly increases the chances that it won't be as severe as her cohort's punishment.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What did Allison do during her time at Nxivm?</h2><p>Although it's probably not fully clear at this point what the extent of Allison's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">role at Nxivm</a> was, she admitted under oath that she tried recruiting other women and forced women to give her humiliating personal information and photographs to be used as blackmail.</p><p>"I'm very sorry for the victims of this case. I'm very sorry for who I've hurt through my misguided adherence to Keith Raniere's teachings," she stated in court.</p><p>One of the people Allison abused, a woman who went simply by Nicole, was interviewed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> and shared her horrifying experiences with Allison.</p><p>Nicole told Rolling Stone that Allison coerced her to write false accusations against her father, including that he molested her as a child. When Nicole wanted to leave, Allison told her that it wasn't possible and that being part of the cult was a "lifetime commitment."</p><p>Allison also forced Nicole to "show her devotion" by blindfolding her and driving her to a location where someone raped her. (Allegedly it was another woman in the group who was forced to perform oral sex on Nicole.) Nicole also alleged that Allison and Keith were in a sexual relationship.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just want to know when Allison Mack is in jail.

"Things would get normalized and slowly become more intense. ... If you put a frog in hot water, they just jump out. If you put a frog in cold water and slowly turn the heat up, they just boil it to death," she said.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you need support, The National Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 at&nbsp;1-800-656-4673.
