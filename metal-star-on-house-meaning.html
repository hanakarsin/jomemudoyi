They're referred to as Amish Barn Stars, Barnstars, and Pennsylvania Stars, and there's a lot of myth and superstition surrounding this prominent exterior decor. One of the <a href=#>wildest urban myths</a> is that the metal star is a code for the homeowners identifying as <a href=#>swingers</a>, which isn't true — at least, not universally.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The rumor seems to have started in 2007 when someone started a thread on <a href=# rel=nofollow>stripersonline.com</a> claiming that the metal star means the homeowners are swingers, and the conclusion seems totally arbitrary. "My wife and I decide to start a rumor - the star means you are a swinger," the user wrote. According to the New York Post, there are several "secret signs" that a <a href=# rel=nofollow>homeowner is a swinger</a>, and all should be taken with a grain of salt, as none of these signs have been substantiated. For instance, pampas grass, pink flamingos, and pineapple decor also allegedly means that you're in the midst of a family of swingers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do metal stars on houses actually mean?</h2><p>These metal stars allegedly originate from German settlers who came to Pennsylvania between 1727 and 1775, all of whom emigrated from the Rhine region of Germany. These immigrants belonged to the Amish, Mennonite, and Lutheran groups. Some of these folks brought with them various symbols and patterns to put on their barns, but over time, these symbols simplified and became a more unifying star. The stars became more popular after the Civil War, as they were believed to be patriotic and they also represented barn builders. The original stars were believed to manifest good fortune.</p><p>According to Pioneer Thinking, the original settlers "painted colorful <a href=# rel=nofollow>geometric patterns on their barns</a>. Many were floral designs, birds and, stars, many of them look[ing] like a quilt patch. The people assigned specific meanings for each symbol. Somehow through time the geometric symbols evolved through the Pennsylvania Dutch farmers as ‘hex’ signs. They were to bring the families good luck.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Residents who live in <a href=# rel=nofollow>a home with a Barnstar</a> shared, via The Voice of Pelham, “They are everywhere in Vermont, and that is where we spend a month in October. We inquired when we purchased a few while in Vermont, and were told that the star signifies ‘Welcome.’ In Vermont where there are old barns everywhere, the stars on the houses or barns are more rustic than the one I painted on our house. They are usually a rust color. I know that they date way back to horse and buggy days.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's also believed that the history of the metal stars go back even before the Amish. It's possible they come from China and were considered "good luck stars." One woman states, “The people at the store told me they started as Chinese good luck stars and were later adopted by the Amish with the same meaning,” per The Voice of Pelham.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Nowadays, some homeowners paint their stars, as certain colors are believed to represent various meanings. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>metalbarnstars.com</a>, black means protection, blue means protection, peace, and calmness, brown means earth and friendship, green means growth and fertility, orange means success in career, red means emotion, passion, and creativity, violet alludes to something sacred, white represents the power of the moon, and yellow means health.&nbsp;</p><p>Now ya know!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforK1rctmqq2ZomK8r3nHqKysnV2isqK6yKee</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmetal-star-on-house-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmetal-star-on-house-meaning.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmetal-star-on-house-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmetal-star-on-house-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmetal-star-on-house-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmetal-star-on-house-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./howtobasic-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./howtobasic-html.html>HowToBasic - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-tiktok-prankster-mizzy.html>A TikTok Prankster Broke Into a Stranger's Home as a Joke Which Is Definitely Not Comedy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-happened-tiktok-prankster-mizzy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
