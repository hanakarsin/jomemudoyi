The ship was full of supplies; medicine, powdered food, and batteries. The supplies were delivered the following day. That commitment became ongoing and led to the expansion of the volunteers. The Concern Africa’s operation then later materialised into one flight a day for eleven months. Over time, it was not just aid but the increased number of volunteers who have helped in a quick response with practical solutions which saw the organisation head to a new direction. In 1970 when a huge cyclone hit the eastern parts of Pakistan, which is now Bangladesh, the public was asked to respond, and they responded. It is from these small beginnings; together with visionary leaders that Concern Worldwide was born.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/33579f468953d79e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best African countries to live and work in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Concern Worldwide Kenya has been in existence since 2002. While originally urban-based, the organization has now expanded its work in Kenya into a multi-sectoral programme that focuses on urban and rural livelihoods, water and sanitation, primary education, health and nutrition, and governance as later discussed on this article. The organisation is currently working in rural Marsabit County and slums of Nairobi. Concern Worldwide Kenya also works in collaboration with other local organisations to help in responding to various emergencies resulting from drought, floods, and violence. All its work is underpinned on the promotion of advocacy, community empowerment, and governance initiatives.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Funds for NGOs in Kenya</p><h2>Services offered by Concern Worldwide Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>The various services offered by the organisation include;</p><h3>Emergency response</h3><p class=align-left>The state of food insecurity in Marsabit is a serious one. Recently, the organisation developed a SURGE model which is working great in supporting health services and in preparation of emergencies and treatment cases of malnutrition in the region. Concern Worldwide Kenya has launched the emergency response which focuses on the provision of water and nutrition services. They are also providing Aquatabs to more than 7,500 families which make it easier for the families to purify water, hence getting enough safe water for drinking. The program will also see 1443 families receive cash payments over the next three months in Dukana ward. This money will help them buy food and medicine as well as other important things they may need. The organisation is also engaging in long term programming to enable them to build local resilience.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5478773754ab5d70.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest NGO jobs in Tanzania 2020</span></p></a><h3>Health and nutrition</h3><p class=align-left>The organisation also works to improve the nutritional and health status of children. They also extend care to pregnant and lactating mothers from poor communities. The program by Concern Worldwide Kenya also offers support to health clinics in phases depending on the number of children who come for treatment. This ensures that clinics do not experience too much pressure especially when the cases are on the rise. Concern Worldwide distributed supplementary food in North Horr Sub-county, to the starving mothers. This, as a result, saw the number of cases with Severe Acute Malnutrition drop from 9.86 to 5% in 2017. Their Blanket Supplementary Feeding programme also reached 2692 pregnant and lactating women as well as 15, 084 children under the age of five.</p><h3>Education</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/33579f468953d79e.jpeg><p class=align-left>Concern Worldwide Kenya has an education programme aimed to increase the right to free education for children.

In Kisumu, a total of 125 community conversation members influenced the decision to include their community action plans on the county annual budget.</p><h2>Concern Worldwide Kenya contacts</h2><p class=align-left>Telephone: +254 20 3755051-5</p><p class=align-left>Fax: +254 20 3755056</p><p class=align-left>Email: Nairobi.admin@concern.net</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs77qqoue8oip.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Big Four Agenda of the government explained</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Facebook: <a id=https://www.facebook.com/concernworldwide/ href=# title="Concern Worldwide Kenya contacts" rel="nofollow noopener">Concern Worldwide</a></p><p class=align-left>Instagram: concernworldwide</p><p class=align-left>Twitter: @ConcernKenya</p><h3>Nyanza Regional Office</h3><p class=align-left>P.
