After a very public breakup with baby mama Blac Chyna in 2017 and detailing his issues with his weight, Rob took a step back from <a href=#>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</a> and was rarely seen at the many events that his sisters have hosted.</p><p>But, over Halloween weekend, Rob was seen showing off a slimmer physique, and one picture has fans thinking he also has a new lady in his life.

The two have posted enviable pictures on multiple vacations together, and they even coordinated Halloween costumes during several nights of their celebrations.</p><p>On Oct. 31, the entire Kardashian clan came out in full force to celebrate Halloween and Kendall Jenner's birthday. Rob appeared, shocking fans when pictures of him outside of the event were released, and it appeared as though he lost a significant amount of weight.&nbsp;</p><p>Before entering the event, Stassie was photographed grabbing something from a car. Rob then approached her and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> grabbed her waist</a>. The act was immortalized in photos, and speculation began that there was something going on between the two.</p><p>But, according to an inside source close to the family, there is nothing going on between the pair.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>5am birthday adventures with my two fav peopleðŸ¥³</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Kylie âœ¨</a> (@kyliejenner) on Nov 1, 2019 at 6:24pm PDT</p></figure><p>In an exclusive with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Life</a>, a source told the outlet that, "There is absolutely nothing going on between Rob and Stassie.&nbsp;â€œThey have known each other for a long time and he simply looks at her as one of his little sisterâ€™s friends."</p><p>If Rob were to date Stassie, it wouldn't be the first time he's hooked up with one of his sister's friends. Blac Chyna and Kim Kardashian hung out before Rob began dating her, and Blac Chyna also famously has a baby with Kylie's ex, Tyga.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How much weight did Rob Kardashian lose?</h2><p>Fans first got wind of Rob's potential slimdown when photos from Kim's birthday dinner were released on Oct. 21. The Kardashian brother was briefly seen in a video posted to Kim's Instagram stories, and it was clear that he had lost weight.&nbsp;In the days since, both Kylie and Kris Jenner have posted pictures with Rob, a rarity that is showing that he might be ready to enter the public eye again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News </a>(E! is the channel that KUWTK airs on) that Rob has been working with a trainer to meet his weight loss goals.&nbsp;</p><p>"He is also exercising again and working out with a trainer. He gets together with friends to play basketball at his home court and has fun with that too," the source said.&nbsp;</p><p>His new exercise regimen is being matched with a healthier diet, as well.</p><p>"He is very focused on making changes and sticking with it," the source said. "He has cut down on fast food and has completely changed his diet."</p><p>Rob is still wearing baggier clothes in the pictures we've seen of him recently, so it's difficult to determine exactly how much weight the former reality star has dropped. As we saw on the show, Rob skipped Kim's 2014 wedding to Kanye West because he didn't feel comfortable posing for photos at over 300 pounds.</p><p>We're hoping that Rob's slow resurgence in the media means that we might be seeing him on the show very soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping Up with the Kardashians airs on Sundays at 9 p.m. on E!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7yjecqaqZ2Zo522orqMmqWdZaOprrS%2FyJ4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frob-kardashian-and-stassie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frob-kardashian-and-stassie.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frob-kardashian-and-stassie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frob-kardashian-and-stassie.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frob-kardashian-and-stassie.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frob-kardashian-and-stassie.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cyrina-fiallo-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cyrina-fiallo-html.html>Cyrina Fiallo - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./amir-slama-html.html>Amir Slama - Idade, Vida Pessoal, Biografia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./amir-slama-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
