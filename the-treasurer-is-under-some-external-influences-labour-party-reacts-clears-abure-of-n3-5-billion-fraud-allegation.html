Evidence is our proactive outing in the 2023 general election as the party presented for the first time a very good presidential candidate.</p><p>“Let it be said that the Labour Party has not earned N3.5 billion as claimed and that the National Chairman has not embezzled any money that belongs to the party as alleged. The records are there, except that Ms Oluchi Opara doesn’t even understand simple accounting even as a treasurer. An External Auditor is engaged by the party and our account is under constant scrutiny of INEC or other regulatory bodies.</p><p>“Abure does not own several houses and property as spuriously alleged by our estranged National Treasurer, even though no law prohibits him from owning properties.</p><p>“The constitution of the Labour Party in Article 14:1b provides that the National Chairman shall be the Accounting Officer of the party while 14:1d ‘Shall approve all expenditures and shall be a signatory to the Party’s Bank account(s).’</p><p>“Accordingly, Article 14: 6 states that the National Treasurer “Shall receive and promptly pay into the Party’s account(s), all monies received for and on behalf of the Party.</p><p>“‘Shall ensure the preparation of Annual Statement of Account/Reports on finances of the Party including compilation of the Party’s Assets and liabilities and make the same available to the National Executive Council from time to time. Shall be a co-signatory to the Party Account(s).’</p><p>It further stated: “These sections are clear as to the duty of the national chairman apart from providing leadership. The duty of the National Treasurer is also clearly spelt out.</p><p>“In the past, the party didn’t have accounting books or methods as it was run by the then chairman and Ms Oluchi the Treasurer. They were only accountable to themselves, but with the emergence of the Abure-led executive, and the growth of the party, it became imperative for the party to structure its accounting method and policy. This of course didn’t go down well with the National Treasurer whose financial source was shut down.</p><p>“The party can understand her vituperations but we can’t help her situation more so when her time in the NWC is running out. Her wish to cash out was not granted and her subtle effort to push the leadership to ‘settle’ her was rejected hence her resolve to fight dirty.</p><p>“It will be recalled that she is alone in this battle. Several stakeholders have had course to prevail on her to bridle her inordinate ambition but all to no avail. We are surprised that despite all efforts to assure her of a future, she still went ahead to align with our detractors and sworn enemies of the party.</p><p>“The party will definitely take her case to the disciplinary committee where appropriate measures will be taken.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BrZq2glWLBs7HArKyrnaJitrR51KebnqpdqLyusYyer62doqOurXnIp52lrZWjsKa%2FjKWYm6elp3qxrdGtsGaqlZawtb%2BMnKOemaKoeqKu1KucZqeWYrt0eZRmmaKknJ68r3nFq5iunF2Wua2xxpqroqeeZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-treasurer-is-under-some-external-influences-labour-party-reacts-clears-abure-of-n3-5-billion-fraud-allegation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-treasurer-is-under-some-external-influences-labour-party-reacts-clears-abure-of-n3-5-billion-fraud-allegation.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-treasurer-is-under-some-external-influences-labour-party-reacts-clears-abure-of-n3-5-billion-fraud-allegation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-treasurer-is-under-some-external-influences-labour-party-reacts-clears-abure-of-n3-5-billion-fraud-allegation.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-treasurer-is-under-some-external-influences-labour-party-reacts-clears-abure-of-n3-5-billion-fraud-allegation.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-treasurer-is-under-some-external-influences-labour-party-reacts-clears-abure-of-n3-5-billion-fraud-allegation.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./429544-gumzo-zazuka-baada-ya-mlinzi-wa-rais-uhuru-kutumwa-kumlinda-raila-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./429544-gumzo-zazuka-baada-ya-mlinzi-wa-rais-uhuru-kutumwa-kumlinda-raila-html.html>Gumzo Zazuka Baada ya Mlinzi wa Rais Uhuru Kutumwa Kumlinda Raila</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./we-igbos-are-undoing-ourselves-killing-ourselves-gov-umahi.html>We Igbos Are Undoing Ourselves, Killing Ourselves</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./we-igbos-are-undoing-ourselves-killing-ourselves-gov-umahi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
