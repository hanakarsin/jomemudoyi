The platform brings users together to discuss their thoughts and opinions on topics you may not otherwise consider.</p><p>In this specific case, commenters discuss anomalies such as double uvulas and third nipples. And guess what? More people have abnormal bodies than you may think. So, what are the strange things about their bodies that users are willing to share? Find out below.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Some of the strange things people notice about their bodies are actually discussed by celebrities.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit/@amistakewasmadehere</a></figure><p>One commenter to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit post</a> admitted to having a third nipple. The person said, "I have a third nipple. I always thought it was a mole on my rib cage and I actually used to like it and kinda thought it was cute."</p><p>"As soon as I discovered the truth, I immediately started to dislike it. And it’s funny but it actually does make me feel exposed when I’m wearing a bra or bikini and one of my nipples is showing. Lol," the user continued.</p><p>A fun fact that might make this user feel better is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several celebrities</a> have admitted that they too have a third nipple. Stars <a href=#>Lily Allen</a> and <a href=#>Mark Wahlberg</a> have been candid about this abnormal body feature.</p><p>However, a fun <a href=#>Harry Styles</a> fact is that he actually has four nipples!</p><p>"They’re a bit smaller than the other ones so I don’t look like a cow,” he <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> during an interview with NOVA FM in 2012.</p><p>More "ordinary" folks weighed in with their own fun facts about extra nipples. One even said, "Just FYI — it actually will engorge during lactation if you decide to have kids."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">There are many more strange things people notice about their bodies.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit/@amistakewasmadehere</a></figure><p>Many users admitted to strange and abnormal features of their bodies. One person confessed to having a big head, and instead of being teased, he received supportive comments from others who share this same issue.</p><p>"When I joined the army, they didn't have a hat big enough for me," a user admitted. "They cracked up... And called me Charlie Brown. It took two weeks of that before a hat arrived big enough for me."</p><p>Another user admitted to have astigmatism, which is a defect in the eye that causes blurred distance and near vision. One person thanked the user for their post, as it helped them realize their own astigmatism.</p><p>They said, "I knew about the lens flare, but I get the ‘double’ vision as well — like a second image but a dulled or semi transparent version, but each eye does it, so it’s not my eyes being misaligned."</p><p>"I thought I was weird, but it turns out that’s the astigmatism too!" the person concluded.</p><p>From irregular heartbeats, to tongue abnormalities, to hyperactive eyebrows, hey, the lesson here seems to be that no matter what you may think is weird about your body, someone out there can relate.</p><p>Of course, it's important to note that if you do notice something peculiar about your body, and it's causing you pain, or you are concerned, rather than linger on Reddit, it's a good idea to seek medical attention to be sure you understand what's going on with you.</p><p>Then, head back to Reddit to commiserate with folks who know just how you feel. Or, don't feel. Since as someone shared in the thread, "My body eats anesthesia. So, it's take twice as much anesthesia for half the time. That was a surprise for the first intervention!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGzrc2gnGasmJ67qL%2BMqZyoqJyaeq%2B706KanmWRl7y2wIytn56homKvsLDInqo%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstrange-things-people-notice-about-their-bodies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstrange-things-people-notice-about-their-bodies.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstrange-things-people-notice-about-their-bodies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstrange-things-people-notice-about-their-bodies.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstrange-things-people-notice-about-their-bodies.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstrange-things-people-notice-about-their-bodies.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tracy-morgan-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tracy-morgan-html.html>Tracy Morgan - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./417482-matiangi-aongoza-mkutano-wa-raila-na-viongozi-wa-kisii-html.html>Matiang'i Aongoza Mkutano wa Raila na Viongozi wa Kisii</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./417482-matiangi-aongoza-mkutano-wa-raila-na-viongozi-wa-kisii-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
