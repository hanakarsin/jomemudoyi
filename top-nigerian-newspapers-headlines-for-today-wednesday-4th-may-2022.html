May 2022</h2><p>The Presidency has distanced President Muhammadu Buhari from alleged plans to allow former President Goodluck Jonathan to succeed him in 2023.</p><p>In a chat with Daily Independent, a senior presidential aide said the President was not behind the move to lure Jonathan into the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and make him the party’s consensus candidate in the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>He stated that President Buhari would never allow Jonathan to succeed him after he heavily criticised him for mismanaging the resources of the country while in office for

loyalists to reject the election.</p><p>The Nigerian Army High Command has condemned the gruesome murder of two soldiers by members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its militia

companies, which he allegedly used as a cover to import illicit drugs into Nigeria.</p><p>The leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum, Edwin Clark, has described the decision of the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress to allow Northern candidates contest for their party’s ticket as unfair.</p><p>Clark stated this while calling for the presidency in 2023 has to be zoned to the South-East extraction.</p><p>He noted that no Nigerian would like to live in a country where some people believe they have the only right to lead.</p><p>According to Clark, if the presidency is not

Tuesday.</p><p>The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, arrived in Nigeria on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>The Portuguese politician and diplomat, Naija News understands was received at the

Hon. Akin Oyebode.</p><p>The Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu on Tuesday stated that the All Progressives Congress must take a definite position on zoning.</p><p>There have been calls for the ruling party to state its position on zoning ahead of the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>According to Akeredolu, it is the turn of the Southern part of the country to produce the next president of the country.</p><p>He said the party leadership should not find it difficult in making pronouncements on the issue of zoning.</p><p>The Chairman of South West Governors’ Forum in a statement on Tuesday warned the party not to allow the issue of zoning to throw it into another round of crisis.</p><p>Former Kaduna lawmaker Shehu Sani has revealed the only way a Southerner will succeed Buhari in 2023.</p><p>As the 2023 elections draw closer different groups have been demanding that the south and in particular, the southeast produce the next president in the country.</p><p>However the two major political parties PDP and APC have not spoken on the decision to zone their presidential ticket.</p><p>Sharing his thoughts via Twitter on Tuesday, Sani stated that the only way a Southerner would emerge as president is if both APC and PDP pick a southern candidate.</p><p>The upgrade of the Nigeria Police Crime and Incident Database (NPC & IDB) Centre has been carried out by the Police Force under the leadership of IGP Usman Alkali Baba.</p><p>The aim is to provide additional aid to police operatives in acquiring credible electronic criminal database to support investigations and strategic operational and tactical planning which would, in turn, facilitate easy identification of suspects, crime location, modus operandi, Global Positioning System (GPS) to geolocate crimes, amongst others.</p><p>A statement on Tuesday signed by the Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi added that “the upgrade of the Nigeria Police Crime and Incident Database, which was commissioned by the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari, in 2020, has become imperative in view of the sophistication of criminals, who now apply technology to perpetuate their nefarious activities.”</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspapers headlines for today.
