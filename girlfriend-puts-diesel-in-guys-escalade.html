And even though you'll be able to find both diesel and gasoline at many of the same pumps, you cannot put diesel fuel in a regular gas engine.</p><p>That's because the thicker density of diesel fuel, it could lead to clogs in gasoline engines, which could result in massive repair costs, depending on whether or not the fuel gets to other parts of the car, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">necessitating a replacement</a>.</p><p>Not everybody knows that diesel fuel can ruin vehicles, and sometimes folks go to the wrong pump when filling up, which is purportedly happened in this viral TikTok.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@king69yep href=#>@king69yep</a><p>SHE PUT DEISEL IN DA ESCALADE <a title=gas href=#>#GAS</a> <a title=relationship href=#>#RELATIONSHIP</a> <a title=why href=#>#WHY</a> <a title=üò≥ href=#>#üò≥</a> <a title=capcut href=#>#CapCut</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - üêä ü¶û 69YEP ü¶û üêä" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - üêä ü¶û 69YEP ü¶û üêä</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @king69yep</span></figure><p>The video, which was posted by TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@king69yep</a>, begins with a man seeing his significant other, who he refers to as "babe," putting diesel fuel in his Cadillac Escalade truck.</p><p>He screams at the top of the video asking her, "Babe! What are you doing?" he immediately runs to the truck after shouting, "You put diesel in my Escalade!" and throws his drink to the ground.</p><p>"You just used this gas in the truck yesterday," she counters, before he tells her that that was a different truck he drives. He pulls the pump out of the car asking her again, "What are you doing?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @king69yep</span></figure><p>"You asked me to pump the gas!" she says.</p><p>"This is diesel!" he shouts.</p><p>"Well why you got me pumping gas anyway!" the woman responds. The frustrated man then tosses the diesel gasoline pump handle on the ground.</p><p>At one point in the video, a police officer approaches the couple presumably to see what all the commotion is about. "You about to mess my engine up," the man continues to shout as the cop intervenes.</p><p>"It wasn't on purpose," the woman says to him. "I didn't do it on purpose."</p><p>The clip then cuts to the man complaining to the officer that his significant other "barely cook[s]" and that "she['s] lazy."</p><p>"She ain't good," the continues, as the camera pans to reveal a tow truck that arrived at the gas station to take the truck away.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @king69yep</span></figure><p>The video ends with footage of the Escalade being loaded onto the tow truck before it ultimately cuts out.</p><p>One commenter didn't seem to agree with the man's outrage over the situation stating that he deserves to have his engine ruined after expecting her to pump his gas.</p><p>"you deserve every ounce of diesel for making your girl pump YOUR gas," the commenter wrote.</p><p>This sentiment seemed to be echoed by another user who penned: "Exactly!! Why u got her pumping yo gas anyway"</p><p>Someone else mentioned that they thought the video was staged until they saw the car loaded onto the tow truck: "I thought it was a skit until it was getting towed"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @king69yep</span></figure><p>There were others who said that the engine wouldn't be ruined and that there was an easy fix to the problem: "It won't ruin the engine. just drain and put the highest octane run for about 5min"</p><p>What do you think? Did the guy overreact in this situation? Should he have pumped the gas himself? Or are you dubious as to the veracity of the encounter and believed that the folks were getting their car towed anyway and they decided to make the most out of the situation to film a "viral" video they could upload online?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLazuMWroJ6mlGK9tsDSZpuinaOauW61zWaerrGjYrK0r8ClmJ2d</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgirlfriend-puts-diesel-in-guys-escalade.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgirlfriend-puts-diesel-in-guys-escalade.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgirlfriend-puts-diesel-in-guys-escalade.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgirlfriend-puts-diesel-in-guys-escalade.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgirlfriend-puts-diesel-in-guys-escalade.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgirlfriend-puts-diesel-in-guys-escalade.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vinay-anand-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vinay-anand-html.html>Vinay Anand - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./is-missing-dead-or-alive-on-netflix-real.html>Dead or Alive on Netflix Real?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./is-missing-dead-or-alive-on-netflix-real.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
