He stayed tight-lipped about his personal life, but he was first spotted kissing Elvira at the 2016 Golden Globe Awards.</p><p>The couple wed a year later, and Oscar went from the internet's boyfriend to Elvira's husband.</p><p>Elvira was born in Copenhagen, and she studied Documentary Film at the Cityvarsity School of Media and Creative Arts in Cape Town, South Africa.</p><p>Like her husband, Elvira is also involved in the film world.

Son Eugene was born on April 25, 2017, and he was named in honor of Oscar's late mom, Eugenia. She passed away a month before Oscar and Elvira got married.</p><p>In 2018, Oscar spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a> about how marriage was never really important to him or Elvira but that they made the decision to make things official rather quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>"Tons of reasons," he said when asked about his quick nuptials in March of 2020. "She's Danish — she's not a citizen, and she was very pregnant, and there was an element of figuring out, 'Well, where are we going to be?' And us wanting to be a family unit a bit more. Also, the Danes, they don't really believe in marriage. I think it has a lot to do with the equality of the sexes over there..." he said. "So the marriage itself becomes less important."</p><p>His mom's grave illness encouraged him to "take that extra step."</p><p>"But, you know, at the time, right before it happened, my mom was ill, and so I saw her carrying my child, bathing my sick mom — seeing her do that, I just thought: I want to be with this person forever and ever. And I just wanted to take that extra step as well," he continued. "And so my mom passed in February and we got married in March and our son was born in April."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Elvira Lind (@elvira_lind_)</a></p></figure><p>Two-and-a-half years after their wedding, Elvira gave birth to the couple's second son in October of 2019.
