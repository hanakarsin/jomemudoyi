From putting Dolce & Gabbana's ad featuring a Chinese model as well as Stefano Gabbana's racist DMs on blast and causing the brand to cancel its planned Shanghai runway show, to more recently shining a light on Marni's racist and reductive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Jungle Mood" campaign</a>, and even starting their own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a> for exclusive content (they already sell branded <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">merch</a>), Tony and Lindsey have been staying busy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>These are the people behind diet prada in black girls business <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YjU8tQuVX4</a></p>— Kimberly (@TheKimbino) <a href=#>July 1, 2020</a></figure><p>"There are many problems in fashion beyond knock-offs," Lindsey said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Company.</a> "We've got a community that wants to hear about these things and keep people accountable."</p><p>Shutting down the Shanghai D&G show was the moment when Diet Prada realized the account was "not just all talk." "I think neither of us expected that would happen," Tony shared. "When we were preparing to call [Dolce & Gabbana] out [for its racist ad], we were like, Oh, maybe some models will drop out or the attendance might be low. But for the entire show to be canceled: that's when we realized, Hey, we can actually do something."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>On July 15, Danielle Bernstein aka @weworewhat posted a picture wearing a pair of simple marigold shorts. “Woke up to so many DMs about these shorts... they’re vintage gym shorts from the 90s and I’m already remaking them for my brand!,” the influencer said, adding that she always finds inspiration in the vintage pieces she collects. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ But Australian Etsy shop @artgarmentsau 's receipts tell a different story. Since 2011, Grace Corby has been collecting vintage and selling curated finds online. “I hand source, shoot, edit and upload, measure & describe, hand wrap & post each piece myself.... it's a labour of love and never really feels like work,” she said. Corby's only non-vintage item is a pair of simple elastic-waist shorts, which are clearly listed as “pre-order." After an uptick in sales when her shop was tagged in the comments of WeWoreWhat’s post, she searched her past orders, finding Bernstein had purchased two pairs on Nov. 11, 2019. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ As with the chain masks, the issue is not the “originality” of the item, but the apparent conscious choice to exploit smaller businesses. “We all know fashion often references vintage, so I'm not sure why my pairs were chosen as a template and not a true&nbsp;90s gym short,” Corby said. Her own shorts are based off a €3 Berlin flea market find, worn until the waist lost its stretch. “I took what remained to a local seamstress with some amendments (longer, wider legs for a bit more coverage, stretchier waist).” ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Many designers reference vintage, and always have. The best transform it by adding their own flavor, even to basic items. “There are ethical ways to use vintage in the inspiration and design process. Tweaking and personalising. Ensuring you're not siphoning credit and revenue from a small Aussie shop.” ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Bernstein has since updated her caption: “these are from Etsy and I totally thought they were vintage but they are made to order - someone on my team ordered them for me a while back. I will not be making them.” Odd, considering it still says she collects her own vintage pieces. Some free advice for Danielle—save yourself the scandal and just visit a thrift shop or flea market yourself.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Diet Prada ™</a> (@diet_prada) on Jul 30, 2020 at 12:11pm PDT</p></figure><p>The duo also "go hard on influencers," who often sell "cherry-picked knock-offs" of designers they have relationships with. Tony also mentions how easy it is for designers, like lingerie brand Fleur du Mal or Balenciaga, to "browse their feed and look at, like, young creatives ... and just swipe their work." "These young creatives are small and don't have the resources to battle in court, not that [the laws] are very favorable in terms of design protection."</p><p>Diet Prada feels "a responsibility to help as much as we can," they say, and their posts have gone a long way to effect change in the real world. Thanks to their interventions, some creators have been able to receive pay from brands that wronged them, and others have pulled their copycat designs. These tangible repercussions are part of what earned the account the moniker of "the most feared Instagram account" by the Business of Fashion.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But are the cancelers getting canceled?
