He Was Also Abducted With Steven Stayner</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-dSnYFs eqMhYP">Kelly Corbett</a><p class="sc-hYRTcE cWmyoM">Apr. 25 2022, Published 12:38 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Hulu</a><p>Steven Stayner and Timothy White were both abducted in broad daylight by Kenneth Parnell.</p></figure><p>In the <a href=#>Hulu</a> docuseries <a href=#>Captive Audience</a>, viewers learn all about Steven Stayner’s abduction at age 7, his miraculous homecoming at age 14, and how the media’s dizzying coverage of his case led to even more tragedy within his family.</p><p>To review, Steven was abducted in 1972 while walking home from school. <a href=#>Kenneth Parnell</a> brainwashed the young child into thinking that his former family no longer cared about him. Steven was taken to an area near Yosemite National Park, miles away from his Merced, Calif., home, enrolled in a new school, and given a new identity (Dennis Parnell).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Hulu</a><p>Steven Stayner was abducted at age 7.</p></figure><p>Burdened by this beast of a secret, Steven spent seven years posing as Parnell’s child and was repeatedly sexually abused by Parnell. But things changed when Parnell brought home a new "son," 5-year-old Timothy (Timmy) White. Much like Steven, Timmy was also taken from his family.</p><p>As Parnell had completely upended Steven's life, Steven didn't want Timmy to have the same experience. Keep scrolling to find out what happened to Timothy White.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Timothy White went missing in 1980 in Ukiah, Calif.</h2><p>By 1980, Steven had been living with his abductor Parnell for seven years. He was now a teenager and knew a lot more about the world than he did when he was first abducted. In fact, when Parnell asked him to assist in the abduction of another young boy, Steven did not cooperate.</p><p>But of course, Parnell had his ways. Timothy White was abducted from Ukiah, Calif. Shortly after, Parnell relocated the three of them to a new area to avoid getting caught.</p><p>This was the final straw for Steven.</p><p>On March 1, 1980, Steven waited until Parnell was at work and hitchhiked with Timothy to Ukiah. The 5-year-old couldn’t remember where he lived, so Steven went to the police station and explained what happened to them.</p><p>Both boys soon made it home. Steven became a hero for escaping, as well as for saving young Timmy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Hulu</a><p>Steven Stayner and Timothy White in 1980 after escaping from Kenneth Parnell.</p></figure><p>Meanwhile, Parnell was caught and sentenced to seven years in prison, but he only served five. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, Parnell was arrested again in January 2003 while trying to buy a child. In 2008, he died in prison while serving his sentence. He was 76 years old.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/this is MONSTERS</a><p>Kenneth Parnell in court.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Timothy White died at age 35.</h2><p>Following Timmy's month-long abduction, he was able to move on and start fresh. He grew up, got married, and became a father of two, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>. Furthermore, he got a job working as a sheriff’s deputy in Los Angeles County in 2005.</p><p>But on April 1, 2010, his life was cut short. Timmy passed away at age 35 after suffering a pulmonary embolism.</p><p>Steven also passed way too soon. He married his wife Jody Edmondson in 1985. In their four years together, they welcomed daughter Ashley, followed by son Steven Jr. But in 1989, Steven unexpectedly died in a motorcycle crash at age 24.</p><p>Captive Audience is currently streaming on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStoZ2ixm7Dx6Krng%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-timmy-white.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-timmy-white.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-timmy-white.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-timmy-white.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-timmy-white.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-timmy-white.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./252864-i-dont-god-i-raila-babu-owino-declares-a-heated-conversation-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./252864-i-dont-god-i-raila-babu-owino-declares-a-heated-conversation-html.html>I don't believe in God, I believe in Raila- Babu Owino declares in a heated conversation</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./supreme-court-how-president-tinubu-prevented-what-happened-in-1983-from-repeating-itself-marafa.html>Supreme Court: How President Tinubu Prevented What Happened In 1983 From Repeating Itself</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./supreme-court-how-president-tinubu-prevented-what-happened-in-1983-from-repeating-itself-marafa.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
