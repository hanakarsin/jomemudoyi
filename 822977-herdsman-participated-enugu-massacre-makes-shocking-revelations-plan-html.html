Out of curiosity, he decided to go through the content of the phone. It was in the process that he discovered hor­rible video clips of a murder scene.</i></p><p><i>"Everything changed imme­diately and he was taken back to the interrogation room. He later confessed that he was the one who took the video while they were slaughtering one of the victims during the Enugu killings. In the video, you could hear him shouting and saying in Hausa ‘I have killed you now. You think that you can kill Fulani herdsmen and go free’.</i></p><p><i>"He personally took the picture to show his family members that he was actually successful and par­ticipated in the killings."</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Tears flow in Enugu as Fulani herdsmen wreak havoc (photos)</p><p>Zure also confessed that over 100 Fulani herdsmen were recruited for the Enugu attack, after being invited from over six states from across the federation.</p><p><i>"He con­fessed that they were more than 100 and were selected from differ­ent states especially from Taraba , Kogi, Benue, Nasarrawa , Kas­tina , Niger and Kaduna states. He claimed that the people of Nimbo had killed so many of their people in the past and government did not do anything about it.</i></p><p><i>"He claimed that they also reported severally to Nimbo elders but they refused to investigate, that was why they de­cided to retaliate,"</i> the police source added.</p><p><i>"He alleged that their people in Nimbo shared Kolanut to all cattle rearers across the country. What it signi­fies is that there is going to be an attack and everyone should send representatives to support them. He alleged that this is their cus­tom and has been existing.</i></p><p><i>"He was nominated to join them because he was born and raised in Enugu by his father who is also a herdsman. Two days before the attack, they all gathered in a community in Kogi and perfected how they would ex­ecute the attack,"</i> the police officer added.</p><p>The&nbsp;police has since commenced serious manhunt for the fleeing herdsmen who they believe have fled the eastern state since the attack.</p><p>And to forestall future occurrences, the dreaded Bakassi Boys may soon be reorganised to also ensure sanity returns to the region.</p><p>Reports suggest that some prominent Igbo leaders, at their meeting over the weekend, decided on urgent need for the Igbo nation to organize the people for self-defence against the invasion and killing of Igbo indigenes by the Fulani herdsmen.</p><p>The dreaded Bakassi Boys, a violent vigilante group mobilized to terminate the troubling armed robbery menace in the south east some years ago, were revealed to have started regrouping to strengthen other vigilante groups to provide security for local communities and towns in the south east.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhXN%2BmHBuZqCVp7G0ucCnZKmZoqm2pLXPmquenF2au7az1GakmqujlrCzsYymmKSdo2LAqbvCpKCnn12nsrexy5qroqeeqHqxuMCnZaGsnaE%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f822977-herdsman-participated-enugu-massacre-makes-shocking-revelations-plan-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f822977-herdsman-participated-enugu-massacre-makes-shocking-revelations-plan-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f822977-herdsman-participated-enugu-massacre-makes-shocking-revelations-plan-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f822977-herdsman-participated-enugu-massacre-makes-shocking-revelations-plan-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f822977-herdsman-participated-enugu-massacre-makes-shocking-revelations-plan-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f822977-herdsman-participated-enugu-massacre-makes-shocking-revelations-plan-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./apc-convention-list-of-buharis-men-kicked-out-by-governors.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./apc-convention-list-of-buharis-men-kicked-out-by-governors.html>List Of Buharis Men 'Kicked Out' By Governors</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./408283-the-10-highest-paying-airlines-world-pilots-html.html>Top 10 highest-paying airlines in the world for pilots in 2022</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./408283-the-10-highest-paying-airlines-world-pilots-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
