They don't care about you at all."</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Mustafa Gatollari</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Published June 18 2024, 3:33 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ladyshreve; Getty Images</span></figure><p>According to Yahoo Finance, the <a href=#>energy drink</a> industry was valued at a whopping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$92.3 billion as of 2022</a>, with analysts believing that figure will more than double by 2032.</p><p>These massive numbers indicate that people love their flavored, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"liquid cocaine"</a> so to speak and that there isn't any sign folks will stop gulping them down anytime soon.</p><p>However, a <a href=#>TikToker</a> named Meagan (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@ladyshreve</a>) says that folks shouldn't be drinking them under any circumstances after her husband ended up begging her to take him to the hospital after he began experiencing chest pains.</p><p>While there were some TikTokers who agreed with her in the comments section of her post, there were others who said these this instances usually only occur when people are pounding multiple energy drinks in a day along with other sources of caffeine.</p><p>"My husband didn't really want me to talk about this it when it first happened but it's been six months and we're gonna go ahead and talk about it. This is the story about how I've become the obnoxious person that tells you that energy drinks are dangerous," Meagan says at the beginning of her video, letting everyone know that this is a topic she feels so very strongly about.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ladyshreve href=#>@ladyshreve</a><p>Please. Put. Down. The. Energy. Drinks. <a title=energydrinks href=#>#energydrinks</a> <a title=hearthealth href=#>#hearthealth</a> <a title=trauma href=#>#trauma</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Meagan ✨" href=#>♬ original sound - Meagan ✨</a></figure><p>She says in no uncertain words that people "need to stop drinking them" and began to recount a scary incident involving her husband, who she says woke her up in the middle of the night one evening, telling her that his "heart was racing" and that "his hands and feet were going numb and he just didn't feel right."</p><p>"I thought he was having a panic attack [and we were] just gonna wait it out and he was like 'No, I think I need you to call 9-1-1. I think I need to go to the hospital.' So I said 'Well look I'm just gonna go start the car,' because it was January and it was snowing; we needed to warm up the car," she continued to recall.</p><p>However, Meagan says that in the time it took for her to warm up the car and then return to her husband inside, he became more and more insistent upon going to the hospital. "We pull up the emergency room, I get him inside ... I'm telling the woman that he's having chest pains and he just doesn't feel right. His heart is racing and he feels like he's gonna pass out."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ladyshreve</span></figure><p>After dropping him off in the hospital, the TikToker said she briefly stepped outside of the healthcare facility in order to move her car and by the time she was back indoors, her husband was already inside of a "triage room."</p><p>"In a matter of less than a minute he was telling the woman 'I think I'm gonna go down, I think I'm gonna go down.' And he was out. All these alarms started going off, his heart stopped."</p><p>At this point, the healthcare worker sprang into action, Meagan says, yanking him out of the chair and "doing chest compression[s]."</p><p>According to the TikToker, the woman had called an alarm and enlisted the help of other healthcare professionals to try and help in reviving her husband.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ladyshreve</span></figure><p>"It was all fast. It was all scary, they had me sitting in a side waiting room until I could see him again. Even when they were bringing him down the hallway I could hear them being like 'He's choking, he's vomiting, he's choking on it, he's down again' and there was literally nothing I could do. They told me to sit in this room and they would come get me when they can," she said into the camera.</p><p>Megan says that when she was brought back into the room and her husband was revived, he was acting all "woozy" and healthcare workers put him on fentanyl. "They ended up like breaking his ribs just to try to ... resuscitate him. It was all extremely, extremely traumatic. We left the hospital with no answers; they sent him to a cardiologist," she said.</p><p>After they saw the cardiologist, Meagan said that they were told there wasn't anything necessarily wrong with her husband ... but that he was consuming too many energy beverages.</p><p>"The cardiologist put him on a heart monitor which he was on for maybe five or six weeks ... but then when he went back they still don't have any answers. There was essentially nothing wrong with him. They said it all came down to the fact that they think that he was dehydrated and was having too many energy drinks."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ladyshreve</span></figure><p>She said that if folks are consuming too many of these energy beverages, then they should really think twice before doing so.</p><p>"So if you're somebody who's downing two, three, four energy drinks a day, I would highly encourage you to stop. Because these companies don't care about you. They don't care about you at all," the TikToker explained.</p><p>"And this can be extremely, extremely, extremely dangerous. Even if you're not doing it for yourself, do it for the people in your life. Because this is something that I've never been able to get over. From his experience, he passed out and doesn't really know what happened, I watched this 105-pound woman drag my husband out of a chair and start chest compressions so hard that she broke his ribs," the TikToker stated.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ladyshreve</span></figure><p>Meagan continued to illustrate just how harrowing the situation was: "I saw everybody flood in. I was pushed against a wall not knowing what to do. So, again, if you're not gonna do it for yourself, do it for the people in your life, so they don't have to witness something like this. Because I don't think it's something that I'll ever be able to get over."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mrpqqnqh6pa3NoJyrq12ks26xzZ6poLFdmb%2Bqusqs</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwoman-warns-dangers-of-energy-drinks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwoman-warns-dangers-of-energy-drinks.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwoman-warns-dangers-of-energy-drinks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwoman-warns-dangers-of-energy-drinks.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwoman-warns-dangers-of-energy-drinks.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwoman-warns-dangers-of-energy-drinks.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./banzz-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./banzz-html.html>Banzz - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-the-code-for-the-secret-door-in-fortnite.html>What Is the Code to the Secret Door in 'Fortnite'?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-is-the-code-for-the-secret-door-in-fortnite.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
