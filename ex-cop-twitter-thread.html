If police officers are able to calm a scenario down, that's a powerful skill to have. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As of 2021, 21 US states still don't require police departments to implement de-escalation training as part of their curriculum</a>.</p><p>And according to Justin-Brown Woods, a former police officer+current teacher, he said that his police training program demonstrated an almost schizophrenic view on handling pressurized situations. In a now-viral Twitter thread, he delineates his reasons for becoming a police officer, and why he ultimately decided to get out of that game after only 10 days.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I was a cop for 10 days. 10 days and then I quit.
