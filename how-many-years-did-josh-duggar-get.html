He will also have to pay fines totaling $50,100 and faces 20 years of probation after he's released. In addition to the probation, Duggar will not be allowed to have unsupervised visitation with children nor will he be permitted to have a computer or to view adult pornography.</p><p>The lesser charge, possession of CSAM, was dismissed during the sentencing hearing, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.

"Until now, he has yet to be held accountable to the extent necessary to cause change in his dangerous pattern of behavior."</p><p>The Dillards continued: "It is unfortunate, but it seems that it may take spending over a decade in federal prison, and still more on probation, for Josh to have any potential for rehabilitation to the point he can safely live in society again. Hopefully, Josh can actually begin to get treatment and begin to work toward a lifestyle where he is less likely to reoffend."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Amy King (@amyrachelleking)</a></p></figure><p>Amy also took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> on the day of her cousin's sentencing hearing to write: "This is the day that smug gross smile slowly fades as he gets locked away."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is the day that smug gross smile slowly fades as he gets locked away.</p>— Amy Rachelle King (@amyduggar) <a href=#>May 25, 2022</a></figure><p>Following the sentencing hearing, she posted a video to Instagram expressing her relief at the more than 12 years her cousin will spend behind bars.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Amy King (@amyrachelleking)</a></p></figure><p>Younger brother Jason Duggar shared statement as well on May 26, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> Stories.
