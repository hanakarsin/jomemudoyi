Gavin is the 3-year-old child featured in multiple viral videos, and he's gotten fame for looking like a big baby.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>TikTok has given the world a new set of <a href=#>Gen Z</a> stars, but the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Baby</a> might be the youngest one to date. The young boy has been dubbed by the public as "Giant Baby" or "Big Baby" but the star of the videos is actually a 3-year-old boy named Gavin. His mother created an account to post videos of her adorable son in mid April of 2020, and the videos went viral almost instantaneously.</p><p>From videos of him behind the steering wheel of a car, to him flipping over a toy, Gavin has become an internet star.</p><p>Though he's only had a presence on the short video app for a brief time, he's already amassed a loyal following, and viewers can't get enough of his videos.</p><p>Who is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Baby on TikTok</a> and why did he get so famous? Gavin's mother has spoken out about why she created the channel in the first place, and she also had a message for some of the more negative viewers on her page.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is the Giant Baby on TikTok?</h2><p>If you go on the "For You" page on TikTok, there's every chance that you'll see a video or two of Gavin, who has gotten a lot of attention for his size. His mom, Kat (she has not revealed her last name or where her family is based) created the TikTok page @Kat.027 on April 19, and within hours, her young son was a bonafide star.</p><p>The most viewed video on Kat's page is of Gavin sitting on his father, Galen, and doing their own variation of the viral Woah challenge, which is always performed to the song of the same name by KRYPTO9095. In their video, Gavin is covered in baby powder. The video has been viewed more than 10 million times.&nbsp;</p><p>Another popular video is one of Gavin flipping over a kid's truck. Many users soon began commenting because of Gavin's size, strength, and resemblance to an adult, and he soon became a meme. &nbsp;</p><p>After Gavin's meteoric rise to fame, his mother spoke to multiple outlets about her son, and she had a message for those who thought that the boy was still an infant. She confirmed in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed</a> that her baby boy has been off the charts for his size since shortly after he was born.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kat.027 href=#>@kat.027</a><p><a title=gav href=#>##gav</a> <a title=boom href=#>##boom</a> <a title=babypowder href=#>##babypowder</a></p><a title="♬ Woah - KRYPTO9095 feat.

"He's been off the charts since after birth."&nbsp;</p><p>When he was born, Gavin had an average weight of just under 7 lbs. Now, he's 43 inches tall (the average height of a 3-year-old is around 36 inches).</p><p>Kat said she was inspired to create the TikTok page starring Gavin after her older son, Caleb, showed her the app. She downloaded TikTok on April 18, and she decided that Gavin would be the perfect star.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was like 'I'm going to post a couple of Gavin,' laughing to my husband like 'I'm going to make Gavin famous,'" she said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider.</a> "I didn't think it would happen. I'm not up-to-date with all these platforms besides Facebook, so my 16-year-old came in here like 'Mom, I mean you're getting tons of views, it's like a lot,' and I was like 'Really?'"&nbsp;</p><p>But, not everyone has been supportive of Gavin online.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kat.027 href=#>@kat.027</a><p><a title=gav href=#>##gav</a> <a title=donttouchmytruck href=#>##donttouchmytruck</a> <a title=chevy href=#>##chevy</a></p><a title="♬ My Truck - Breland" href=#>♬ My Truck - Breland</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gavin's mom had a message for those who were negative about her son online.</h2><p>While Kat said that she's tried to stay away from the negative people online, she did notice that some accused her of shaving Gavin's head to make him look more like a young baby. She told BuzzFeed that Gavin has light reddish hair, but that it didn't show up on the videos as much as it appears in person.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's been good comments, bad comments. There's funny [ones]," she told BuzzFeed. "But some are mean, even a bit harsh about it. He is what he is... We have thick skin, it's no big deal to us. People can be mean online, they're behind a mask."</p><p>But, the hate won't be stopping Kat from posting new content of Gavin. She said that she wants the videos to make people smile.</p><p>"We're in a bad time at the moment. I think he's brought a lot of joy to people," she told BuzzFeed. Whether or not Gavin will appreciate his viral fame in the future remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLaiutNmmZqaqWLBqrfTqKI%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgiant-baby-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgiant-baby-tiktok.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgiant-baby-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgiant-baby-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgiant-baby-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgiant-baby-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./289775-100-best-appreciation-messages-occasion-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./289775-100-best-appreciation-messages-occasion-html.html>100+ best appreciation messages and quotes for every occasion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hunter-schafer-html.html>Hunter Schafer - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hunter-schafer-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
