Thanks to <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>'s single mention of him in "The Tortured Poets Department," many people are revisiting those controversies and the singer's overall career.</p><p>While the controversies Charlie has faced range in severity, we've got a full rundown of every single one. Here's what you need to know about every major backlash he has faced over his career.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Charlie Puth has faced a series of controversies.</h2><p>The most recent controversy that Charlie has faced has to do with the ongoing war in Gaza. Based on a screenshot that was posted online, Charlie has been accused of liking a post from Stranger Things actor <a href=#>Noah Schnapp</a> decrying Hamas and those who support the Palestinian people. Charlie has also been accused of liking other pro-Israel content on social media, although most of this hasn't been verified.</p><p>This has caused controversy online due to the nature of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where 34,000 people have been killed following Israel's invasion. Israel's invasion was in response to a hostile attack by Hamas that killed 1,200 Israelis and took hundreds more hostage. As the war has continued, popular support has swung toward the Palestinians, most of whom weren't directly involved in the Hamas attack.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Other old comments from Charlie have also been dragged up.</h2><p>As is often the case when someone is deemed problematic online, someone will pull up all of their oldest and most inflammatory comments, as if to prove that they were always a little suspect.</p><p>In Charlie's case, one set involves something he said following <a href=#>Kesha's allegations</a> that her producer Dr. Luke had sexually assaulted her. Charlie said that the lawsuit that had been filed was "devastating," but ended things on a strange note.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>hey stays just a reminder that charlie puth has actively spoken up as a israel supporter and liked pro israel posts (in the past and recent) so let’s not tune into this! <a href=#>https://t.co/3UjKJJLAaL</a></p>— moe (@ssickssemble) <a href=#>April 16, 2024</a></figure><p>Charlie said, "Nobody wins at the end of the day.” He added, “I hope Kesha comes out with some new songs because we really need that.” Of course, the lawsuit wasn't equally devastating for both of them. Kesha's musical output probably wasn't the most important thing to emphasize at precisely that moment.</p><p>On top of those comments, Charlie has also faced criticism for the way he explained the song "Attention," which was one of his biggest hits. Many suspect that the song is about his short-lived relationship with Selena Gomez, and while he has never explicitly confirmed that, he has hinted at it.</p><p>In explaining the meaning of the lyrics, Charlie said that they described a woman who invited him up to her hotel room repeatedly, but he wouldn't sleep with her.</p><p>“I knew that she was trying to make me so embedded to her that I would never leave her,” he said. “But I would never get what I wanted out of her. So she was doing that repetitively just to get something out of me, which was to be attached to her hips at all times.”</p><p>Not exactly the most feminist sentiment in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWivsuinGaopam1bq%2FOp6urp6aav7S1xKw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcharlie-puth-controversies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcharlie-puth-controversies.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcharlie-puth-controversies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcharlie-puth-controversies.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcharlie-puth-controversies.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcharlie-puth-controversies.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tinubu-makinde-promises-to-follow-afenifere-on-2023-presidency.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tinubu-makinde-promises-to-follow-afenifere-on-2023-presidency.html>Makinde Promises To Follow Afenifere On 2023 Presidency</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./425618-council-governors-asks-government-deploy-military-war-torn-laikipia-html.html>Council of Governors Ask Government to Deploy Military to War-Torn Laikipia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./425618-council-governors-asks-government-deploy-military-war-torn-laikipia-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
