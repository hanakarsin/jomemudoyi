Alaaka takes a look at new and emerging artistes who are either yet to release an album or have only released their debut album within the past year, with a hope that they do not end up like many one hit wonders.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt7e5m558ui2p.jpeg><p>The question that which musical talents gaining attention now would still enjoy popular relevance in the coming years is a necessarily moot one. We don’t know. Because try as we may, industry experts, journalists, bloggers and other music enthusiasts are all painfully limited by the unimpeachable human inadequacy to accurately predict the future. All of our predictions which derive from rather scant data, and especially bias, amount to little more than conjectures which falls flat as reality unfolds.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Wizkid and international star spotted in the club doing this (Video)</p><p>Indeed, some artistes have shown a lot of early promise only to fade away after one single or two. But where some have faltered, some others have flown. For reasons often reducible to managerial and/or artistic incompetence, we know that not every Retta go on to become Tiwa Savage.</p><p>In recent years, however, Wande Coal, Wizkid, Olamide to name a few have shown that consistency, though difficult to achieve, is possible even in a cutthroat industry.</p><p>I have here compiled a list of new and emerging artistes who are either yet to release an album or have only released their debut album within the past year.</p><p>The five years milestone is important to every artiste in the highly competitive world of afro-pop music, and contained in this list are five local artistes who are young, hot, and banging and would likely remain so in another five years or more.</p><p><strong>1. Lil’ Kesh:</strong> The former YBNL artiste and Olamide’s protégé has shown himself as a force to be reckoned with in the music industry since his acclaimed hit record, Lyrically. Equally adept at rapping as he is at singing, Lil’ Kesh has constantly kept his fans entertained whether on his personal projects or his several featured songs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt2tie6ltn6mrg.jpeg><p>Indeed, like his mentor Olamide would like the world to remember: Lil’ Kesh’s every single is a hit back to back. And with the recent twin launch of his own record label and album, YAGI, he doesn’t seem to be running out of steam yet, and we would just keep our eyes on him while he makes us shoki or speak in tongues with abandon. Go Kesh!</p><p><strong>2. Kiss Daniel:</strong> A raspy voice and a dashingly good-looking face is often enough to make one a pop star; Kiss Daniel, however, seems to understand that a good songwriting skill might keep you hot forever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt2evf8u5n66vg.jpeg><p>Since his megahit ironic love anthem, Woju, Kiss Daniel is proving to be a mainstay at every event with successive hit songs whose appeals cut across from the club to the wedding reception, earning him the adoration of fans and grudging respect from critics.</p><p>His 20-track album ‘New Era’ is currently enjoying rave reviews and, if the title of its first track is to be trusted, we truly might have a New King on our hands in Boy Kiss.</p><p><strong>3. Patoranking:</strong> A rare rendition of Jamaican patois in pidgin and a combination of afro pop music with reggae dancehall sets Patoranking apart from his peers, while he traverses the best of many worlds, bringing joy to a split Naija-carribean fan base.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkytvhbqbdoij34.jpeg><p>His recent collaboration with Ghanaian rapper Sarkodie not only means Patoranking is spreading his reach to neighboring Ghana; the resultant mix No Kissing Baby might prove to be 2016 summer jam.</p><p>Patoranking is hot right now and we suspect the release of his highly anticipated “God Over Everything” album would only make his fire inextinguishable. Wha ya say?</p><p><strong>4. Reekado Banks:</strong> The Mavin Records artiste and controversial winner of Hip Hop World awards Next Rated Artiste have somewhat catapulted himself to popular music relevance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt39dgfratjjqg.jpeg><p>Capable of a catchy hook and with a competent singing voice to match, Reekado Banks under the astute management of Don Jazzy is set to keep on dishing out hits after hits for years to come.</p><p>Hate him or love him the boy is on top, and would likely stay there.</p><p><strong>5. YCEE:</strong> A sound which indistinctly vacillates between Nigerian afro pop and American trap music may earn you stick from purists; but without mincing words, YCEE represents the dominant tenuous tend toward American culture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1d8krgk5tpgg.jpeg><p>A breath of fresh air on the local music scene and one of the leaders of the new school with his strong following; YCee’s efforts on ‘Su Mi’ and Desiigner’s Panda cover adds much gloss to a brief but already shiny career which could also boast of hit singles Jagaban and the eponymous Omo Alhaji.</p><p>It is no gainsay that YCEE’s soon to be released ‘New Wave’ album is one of the most anticipated music events of the year, perhaps second only to the release of another YCEE single. Dude is hot and definitely not letting up.</p><p>This is far from an exhaustive list and you’re welcome to mention what other artistes you think might be relevant in another five years – or even disagree with the names already mentioned here.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhnaAkm5rZqqVq7KiuMSdZK2noGKCbsXOrqWgZZ6etKa%2ByJqlZpmiqba0wNJmm6uhpp67qHnNop6eqpmWu7R5wquYs7FdpbakwNSrnJ1mmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f954354-revealed-top-5-young-nigerian-artists-driving-nigerians-crazy-pictured-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f954354-revealed-top-5-young-nigerian-artists-driving-nigerians-crazy-pictured-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f954354-revealed-top-5-young-nigerian-artists-driving-nigerians-crazy-pictured-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f954354-revealed-top-5-young-nigerian-artists-driving-nigerians-crazy-pictured-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f954354-revealed-top-5-young-nigerian-artists-driving-nigerians-crazy-pictured-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f954354-revealed-top-5-young-nigerian-artists-driving-nigerians-crazy-pictured-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-elliott-growing-up-chrisley.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-elliott-growing-up-chrisley.html>Who Is Elliott on 'Growing up Chrisley'?
