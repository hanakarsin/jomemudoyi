His uploads mainly included latest and exciting video games such as Pokémon, Battle Pirates, Minecraft and Call of Duty. Jimmy, however, gave a new look to his channel when he posted videos on “Worst Intros on YouTube videos”. He however later decided to privatise all his videos.</p><p class=align-left>Donaldson shifted to real life videos to continue building his channel and bringing in more subscribers and viewers. Some were funny videos which required his fans to run along the streets, screaming his name for them to feature in his YouTube videos. In others videos, he did stuff that he considered dump such as, “Destroying my friend’s car and surprising him with a new one”, “I bought a car using only pennies”, “can 20,000 magnets catch a bullet mid-air”, “I flew only using flew blowers’”, “Walking into random stores with 100 dinosaurs”, “Breaking into the world’s toughest safe’”.

He also made a video featuring his mother, “Giving My Mom $100, 000”. This video got over 10 million views.

He uploaded his first video on October, “The Best DIY watermelon life hacks “. He later did “100-degree metal balls vs ice” and “what can you cut with paper”.
