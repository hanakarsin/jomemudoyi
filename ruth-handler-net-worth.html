She’s famous for creating Mattel’s Barbie, but her tax evasion and potential arrest are mentioned in ‘Barbie.’</p><img height=40 width=40 alt="Jamie Lerner - Author" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/dcwXjJZFT/200x200/headshot-1653400328516.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/dcwXjJZFT/200x200/headshot-1653400328516.jpg><p><strong>Spoiler alert: This article contains minor spoilers for </strong><strong>Barbie</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>As <a href=#>Barbie</a> takes over the cultural environment, many of us have started digging into Barbie’s dark history. Some of it is even referenced in Barbie through <a href=#>Rhea Perlman’s</a> depiction of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruth Handler’s</a> ghost. When Barbie tries to escape the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mattel HQ</a>, she stumbles upon Ruth, often credited as the creator of Barbie.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Later in the film, however, there’s a joke about Ruth and trouble with the IRS, leaving many Barbies and Kens slightly confused. Regardless, Ruth was a widely successful and creative businesswoman. Considering the fact she was at the forefront of toy juggernaut Mattel in the 1960s and ‘70s, we have to commend her. So what was Ruth’s net worth before she passed away in 2002?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ruth Handler had a reported net worth of $100 million.</h2><p>According to various sources, Ruth allegedly had a net worth of $100 million at the time of her death in 2002. She passed away from complications of surgery for colon cancer at the age of 85 years old after she had already battled breast cancer. It’s no surprise that she died with a fortune, though. Ruth was responsible for two of Mattel’s most innovative and successful projects.</p><p>To begin with, <a href=#>Ruth founded Mattel</a> along with her husband, Elliot, and their friend Harold “Matt” Matson. (Mattel is a portmanteau of “Matt” and “Elliot.”) The world wasn’t ready for a female CEO, but when Matt left the company behind two years after its founding, Ruth stepped into the role anyway. In 1955, she invested the entire fortune of the company in a new type of advertising.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Ruth Handler</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Former CEO of Mattel</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $100 million</p><p>Ruth Handler co-founded Mattel and is credited as the creator of Barbie dolls.</p><p><strong>Birthdate: </strong>November 4, 1916</p><p><strong>Birthplace: </strong>Denver, Colorado</p><p><strong>Birth name:</strong> Ruth Marianna Mosko</p><p><strong>Father: </strong>Jacob Moskowicz</p><p><strong>Mother: </strong>Ida Moskowicz</p><p><strong>Spouse: </strong>Elliot Handler (m. 1938)</p><p><strong>Children: </strong>Barbara Handler (b. 1941), Kenneth Handler (1944–1994)</p><p>She decided to target toy ads to children by purchasing 15 minutes of commercial time for each episode of <a href=#>The Mickey Mouse Club</a>. In doing so, the product they promoted tripled sales overnight. This is still a strategy that Mattel (and several other companies) use today to pull on children’s desires and parents' love for their children.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ruth also invented Barbie, although a designer named Jack Ryan disputed that his role in Barbie’s creation has been overlooked. Jack was debaucherous, to say the least—he used his high earnings to buy a “castle” where he hosted many drug-fueled orgies, despite having a wife and child. He sued Mattel for $16 million when he felt he was underpaid, but that’s not the lawsuit referenced in Barbie.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Although Ruth Handler was indicted but not arrested in 1978 for conspiracy and mail fraud, but not tax evasion.</h2><p>Mattel and the Handlers definitely had their fair share of scandal, but tax evasion was not part of that. The crimes Ruth was indicted on were more related to misleading the shareholders. Mattel was a publicly traded company early in its formation, so Ruth had a responsibility to shareholders to accurately report earnings.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In 1974, a class-action lawsuit against Mattel found that the company had fudged some of its numbers. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a>, “It appears that Mattel's reported pretax income of approximately $34 million for fiscal year 1971 may have been overstated as the result of the misstatements in the approximate magnitude of $15 to $20 million.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Barbie was literally invented by Ruth Handler to let little girls imagine being astronauts and politicians at a time when they were expected to be housewives, so if you're surprised by the movie being "woke" then that's a you problem, bud.</p>— 𝐤𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐩𝐚𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐢 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 (@DonutHolschtein) <a href=#>July 21, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Basically, the issue is that the shares of Mattel were traded at inflated prices when they were worth much less during a decline no one wanted to admit. Ruth and Elliot were forced to resign in 1975. As investigations continued, Ruth was indicted in 1978 for fraud and false reporting to the SEC. She pleaded no contest to avoid an arrest and jail time. Instead, she was fined $57,000 (a small dent in her large net worth) and 2,500 hours of community service.</p><p>It’s likely that Ruth’s daughter, Barbara (for whom Barbie was named) now manages the Handler estate. Even with the legal tragedy that struck the Handlers, Ruth was definitely a pioneer of her time. A first-generation Jewish woman who became a CEO against all odds? When we take Ruth’s story into account, Barbie is so much more than a perfect blonde depiction of a woman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp8K1tIyhmKecnJq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fruth-handler-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fruth-handler-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fruth-handler-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fruth-handler-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fruth-handler-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fruth-handler-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kellie-bright-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kellie-bright-html.html>Kellie Bright - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1322345-robin-tunney-bio-age-height-net-worth-movies-and-tv-shows-html.html>Robin Tunney bio: age, height, net worth, movies and TV shows</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1322345-robin-tunney-bio-age-height-net-worth-movies-and-tv-shows-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
