<time>27 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Nigerians have remained in topsy-turvy following the new development in&nbsp;the country’s downstream oil sector.</strong></p><p>Legit.ng recalls that the federal government on Wednesday, May 11, removed subsidy from sale of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) also known as petrol with immediate effect.</p><p>According to the government, a benchmark of N145 per litre, has been recommended as pump price.</p><p>The announcement was made by Ibe Kachikwu, minister of state for petroleum, who however promised the price will not stay for so long.</p><p>This however didn’t go down well with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), who vowed to go on strike to force the federal government to revert to the former pump price of petrol (now pegged at N145).</p><p>But just as both labour unions planned an industrial action to force the federal government to revert to the former pump price of petrol, the government filed a suit at the Industrial court to restrain them from embarking on strike. And in the early hours of Wednesday, May 18, the court read an injunction against NLC and TUC not to go on strike. The court order shows that should the NLC and TUC go ahead with the industrial action, then they are going against the law.</p><p>Just before the court order, a meeting into the night of Tuesday, May 17, between the federal government and the labour workers to reach a compromise over the proposed action, ended in a deadlock.</p><p>Although it was gathered that the federal government has agreed to set up a committee that will review the new fuel pump price as well as the minimum wage issue which the workers have been agitating over.</p><p>However, Legit.ng fact-check today, May 18, have showed that people have carried on with their usual daily activities despite NLC’s position to embark on strike to protest the fuel hike. However, there are cracks in the house of the labour union as a faction have chosen to pull out from the industrial action.</p><p>From Lagos to Ogun to Edo, Delta, Abuja and several parts of the country, Nigerians were seen carrying on with their normal daily activities. This however has triggered the ire of some others who have taken to the streets to harass motorists.</p><p>Legit.ng is on the streets of Lagos, Abuja and many other major states in the country. We are going to be bringing live coverage of how Nigerians are reacting to the strike action from the labour union.</p><p>Legit.ng will also appreciate feedback from our readers on the situation of things in their areas. Send updates to&nbsp;<strong>info@corp.legit.ng</strong></p><p>5pm' Just as the planned industrial action flopped in many parts across the country, the NLC&nbsp;has threatened to ground flight operations at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos from Thursday, May 19.</p><p>If the federal government refuses to revert the pump price of petrol to N87 per litre.</p><p>Adelegan Solomon, vice-president, NLC, made this known while addressing protesters at the MMIA over the government’s removal of fuel subsidy.</p><p>Solomon, who is also the President of the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees (AUCPTRE), urged Nigerians to unanimously reject the hike in fuel price.</p><p>According to him, the N145 per litre announced by the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) will further increase the suffering of ordinary Nigerians.</p><p>He noted that Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) were members of AUCPTRE, adding that arrangements have been perfected to ground flight operations at the airport from Thursday.</p><p><i>“Today, few planes have taken-off and landed on this airport but by tomorrow, no plane will land or take off. It is operation occupy Lagos State,’’</i> Solomon said.</p><p>4pm' &nbsp;In Lagos, the NLC protest is looking more like an endurance trek at the moment as security operatives are keeping watchful eyes on the protesters, likewise trying to checkmate their actions.</p><p>3.28pm'&nbsp;In Taraba state ministries in the state and public schools were closed as workers comply with the NLC strike</p><p>3pm'&nbsp;Adamu Ango, chairman of the Kaduna NLC has said the union in his state won't force any worker to comply with the strike order. According to him, compliance is only in few states and not compulsory.</p><p>2.30pm' In Lagos, the roads are beginning to enjoy a lit bit of freedom despite the labour union strike. Legit.ng's correspondent around the Ikeja-Maryland axis have observed motorists now ply the major roads without any form of hindrance and many business activities have continued to go on smoothly.&nbsp;Although the protesters have remained dogged in their strike action, despite heavy security presence.

Speaking to Legit.ng, a resident who chose to remain anonymous said: <i>"Many Nigerians have refused to join NLC in the strike because we understand the rationale behind FG 67% increase in fuel price.

"At least, you can see for yourself that activities are going on here and other banks around here. Oke Ilewo is the economic nerve centre of Abeokuta, you can attest to it that normal activities are going on everywhere,no cause for alarm.
