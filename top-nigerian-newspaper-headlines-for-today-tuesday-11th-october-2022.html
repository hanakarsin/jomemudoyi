style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspaper headlines in Nigeria for today, Tuesday, 11th October 2022</h2><p>The President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari has given the All Progressives Congress (APC) the mandate of winning the 2023 election.</p><p>Buhari made the call on Monday in Abuja during the inauguration of the Tinubu-Shettima women presidential campaign team, where he was represented by his Chief of Staff, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari.</p><p>According to him, he believes in the ability of the team to mobilize and deliver victory for the APC at the polls but they need to understand the magnitude of the responsibility committed into their hands.</p><p>The President praised the role of women in the electoral process and charged them not to limit their efforts to Abuja but ensure their presence is felt in all the 774 local government areas of Nigeria.</p><p>The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on Monday revealed that the union will sign some documents in the next couple of days.</p><p>The President of ASUU, Emmanuel Osodeke, revealed this after meeting with the leadership of the House of Representatives.</p><p>The leadership of ASUU led by Osodeke and lawmakers led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, met behind a closed door for about 30 minutes.</p><p>After the 30 minutes closed-door meeting, the lawmakers and ASUU leadership had another meeting in front of the camera.</p><p>Gbajabiamila while speaking on the outcome of the meeting on Monday said President Muhammadu Buhari will make a major announcement regarding the strike.</p><p>Osodeke, also stated that the Union will sign some documents in the next couple of days which they will take to their members for ratification.</p><p>Former Governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun, has declared his support for the governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Biyi Otegbeye, in next year’s election.</p><p>Amosun announced his controversial decision despite his support for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.</p><p>The lawmaker disclosed that he would be supporting Tinubu in 2023, but would not support the state Governor, Dapo Abiodun who is the governorship candidate of the party.</p><p>There are indications that the relationship between Amosun and his political son, Adekunle Akinlade has gone sour.</p><p>Recall that Amosun in 2019 supported Akinlade who contested under the platform of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) against Abiodun who eventually won the governorship election.</p><p>A further report has it that Akinlade fell out with Amosun following his decision to dump APC for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) where he got the deputy governor’s slot.</p><p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the 2023 general election has officially flagged off its presidential campaign in Akwa Ibom State.</p><p>Naija News gathered that the presidential campaign is been held at the Nest of Champions Stadium in Uyo, the state capital.</p><p>Some of the dignitaries in attendance at the event, include the presidential candidate of the party, Atiku Abubakar, his running mate and Governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa and the Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel.</p><p>Others include the Governor of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed, the Governor of Adamawa State, Ahmadu Fintiri, former vice president, Nnamdi Sambo, former Governor of Niger State, Babangida Aliyu and the former lawmaker representing Kogi West, Dino Melaye among other top party officials.</p><p>However, the camp of the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike was nowhere to be found as the party kicks off its presidential campaign.</p><p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) has urged a former Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara to stop hiding under the umbrella of religion to attack the party’s presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and his running mate, Senator Kassim Shetimma.</p><p>According to the statement by APC on Monday, Dogara is an unstable politician who is pained that he lost out to Shettima in the race to emerge as the party’s vice presidential candidate for the 2023 election.</p><p>Instead of attempting to cause further disaffection in the party, the APC statement issued by the Director, Media & Publicity of the Presidential Campaign Council, Bayo Onanuga urged Dogara to accept defeat.</p><p>Naija News reports Onanuga was reacting to the outcome of a consultative meeting and dialogue between Northern APC Christian Leaders and Northern Muslim Political Leaders held on Saturday, October 8, 2022, at NAF Conference Centre, Kado, Abuja.</p><p>The meeting of the northern religious and political leaders was in line with the resolve of Christian leaders within the ruling camp, led by the immediate-past Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir David Lawal.</p><p>The political stakeholders are working with their Muslim counterparts in the North to adopt one of the presidential candidates in a bid to defeat the same-faith presidential ticket of the APC.</p><p>However, Onanuga said those at the meeting are not members of the APC but impostors hired by Dogara and his loyalists.</p><p>He claimed the attendees are opportunists and selfish people, not northern Christians as claimed.</p><p>The African Action Congress has knocked the Chairman of Lagos State Parks and Garages management Committee, Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly known as MC Oluomo, over his comment on the Lekki shooting.</p><p>Naija News earlier reported that MC Oluomo had on Sunday claimed that nobody was killed during the shooting at the Lekki TollGate on October 20, 2020.</p><p>He said this during a rally he organised in Lagos in support of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu.</p><p>MC Oluomo asserted that the Lekki shooting could not be linked to the former Governor of Lagos State, adding that the #EndSARS protest was used to smear Tinubu’s name.</p><p>Reacting in a statement by its spokesman, Adeyeye Olorunfemi, AAC slammed MC Oluomo for querying the whereabouts of the bodies of protesters purportedly killed by the Nigerian Army.</p><p>The party described MC Oluomo’s comment as unfortunate, adding that he should be arrested and questioned over his knowledge of the Lekki Massacre, which he claimed was a ‘political game.’</p><p>AAC, therefore, demanded that Akinsanya immediately withdraw his statement and apologise to all Nigerian youths for his careless comment.</p><p>The All Progressives Congress (APC), on Monday, inaugurated its Women Presidential Campaign Council for the 2023 general election.</p><p>Naija News reports that the inauguration was done by President Muhammadu Buhari, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari.</p><p>The event which was held at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa, Abuja, had the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and members of the National Working Committee (NWC) in attendance.</p><p>The APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, and his running mate, Kashim Shettima, were also present at the event.</p><p>A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dele Momodu, has said the 2023 Presidency is between his party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and his counterpart in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu.</p><p>Momodu, who was recently appointed as the Director of Strategic Communications of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council, said this on Monday during an appearance on Channels Television</p><p>Momodu said the presidential flagbearer of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, does not have what it takes to compete with Atiku and Tinubu in the forthcoming polls.</p><p>The veteran journalist said Obi will struggle to get votes in the South West despite his popularity among the youths, adding the support by the youths cannot make the next President.</p><p>The Kogi State House of Assembly complex located at Crusher Area, Lokoja, the state capital was gutted by fire in the early hours of Monday.</p><p>Naija News learnt that the roof of the complex was ripped by fire leading to extensive damage to the floor of the house.</p><p>The State Security Adviser, Jerry Omodara and the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Mathew Kolawole were among the early callers at the assembly complex.</p><p>As of the time of filing this report, the cause of the fire has not been disclosed.</p><p>Kolawole while speaking on the incident said he suspects sabotage but fell short of where the suspected sabotage might be from.</p><p>The Speaker when asked if the fire incident has a link to the recent happening between the Assembly and Dangote group, he said that that is left to the security to determine.</p><p>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been condemned by the All Progressives Congress (APC) for saying its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu is not qualified for the 2023 race.</p><p>The National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Debo Ologunagba during a press briefing last week had said the court ruling which nullified Governor Gboyega Oyetola’s candidacy in Osun State might affect Tinubu.</p><p>Recall that a Federal High Court had nullified the nomination of Oyetola as the governorship candidate of the APC in the July 16, 2022 election.</p><p>The court nullified Oyetola and his deputy’s nomination on the ground that Governor Mai Mala Buni who submitted their names to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) violated the provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Section 82(3) of the Electoral Act 2022.</p><p>PDP also advised Tinubu to clear the air on the discrepancies in his academic qualifications and other controversies.</p><p>APC in its reaction to Ologunagba’s statement, charged the PDP official to seek clarification.</p><h2><strong>Those are the top Nigerian newspaper
