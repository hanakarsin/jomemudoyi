His parents are Ramón Covarrubias and Natalia Garza.</p><p class=align-left>Covarrubias was a local Mexican <a href=#>musician</a> and played a <a href=# title="Ramon Ayala" rel="nofollow noopener">pivotal role</a> in Ramon’s formative years as a budding artist. Covarrubias's accordion gift to his five-year-old Ayala stoked his passion for music.</p><p class=align-left>In 1959, Ramón’s parents moved to the northern state of Tamaulipas to work in the cotton fields. To support his struggling parents, Ayala worked as a shoeshine boy outside a local bar. Slowly, he became drawn to their ballads and the musicians who played at the joint.</p><p class=align-left>While attending a performance, Ramon met Cornelius Reyna. Reyna was then a budding young guitarist who played for different bands. The friendship that culminated from their meeting was a turning point to then 15-year-old Ayala.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0155f6ead782ff09.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nahreel biography: wife, parents, net worth, songs, facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Apart from being an accredited artist, he is also a music composer and songwriter. His success in the Norteño genre translated into immense record sales realized throughout his long musical career.</p><p class=align-left>The Ranchera style is popular in Texas and Mexico. Without insight into this Spanish-inspired style, it is hard to distinguish between the Norteño and Tejano genres. These Spanish tunes have attracted great listeners among Mexican American community and as far as Colombia. The ballads have an overpowering sense of harmony, hence more appealing even to non-Hispanics.</p><h3>Formation of Los Relampagos Del Norte band and journey to the US</h3><p class=align-left>Cornelio and Ramon cemented their friendship. Later the duo established the famous Los Relampagos Del Norte (The Lightning from the North). They hit it off well and soon started recording accordion music of conjunto genre, which had roots in Texas, but at the time, was deemed independent of Norteño style.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/28eaf4821df21af3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Koffi Olomide bio: wife, children, family, net worth, songs</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Luck would later smile on their way. Paulino Bernal, the co-founder of Conjunto Bernal, gave the duo an offer: of a ticket to cross the border to the US to record their album. They accepted the offer. With financial assistance from Paulino, the two musicians applied for visas, enabling them smooth travel to the US.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2253d545b79f25b3.png><p class=align-left>In 1963, Los Relámpagos del Norte compiled their <a href=# title="Ramon Ayala" rel="nofollow noopener">first album</a> that featured the hit track, <i>Ya No Llores </i>(Don’t Cry Anymore). What followed were performance tours in several states including, California, Washington, and Florida. The success of that followed enticed the band to release eight more albums, which managed to top the charts.</p><h3>More musical alliances and success</h3><p class=align-left>The astronomical rise of Ramon and his group came with its fair share of challenges. Cornelio Reyna left the group in 1971 to pursue a solo career in mariachi music. However, vocalist, Antonio Sauceda, joined the band to fill the position vacated by Cornelio. The changes necessitated the rebranding of the band as Ramón Ayala y sus Bravos Del Norte.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0e39279fa508be71.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Geoffrey Lutaaya biography: wife, family, education, politics, songs</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although Cornelio reunited with Ramon in 1995 and recorded an album, Juntos Para Siempre, he died two years later. Tragically enough, Antonio also left the band in pursuit of his religious faith in a Christian seminary.</p><p class=align-left>Not long after, Ramon’s brother, together with Elisio Robles, joined Satellites de Fidencio Ayala. The new alliance realized success, having struck a unique style of Norteño music. Ramón Ayala y Sus Bravos del Norte's record album sales in Mexico and America, is still to date, the best highlight of their musical exploits.</p><p class=align-left>Just when Ramon was basking in newfound fortunes, Eliseo Robles exited the group in 1990, only to be replaced by singer Antonio Coronado. But as fate would have it, Antonio quit the band later in 1992, leaving Ramon without a lead singer.</p><p class=align-left>In 1993 Mario Marichalar, the current lead singer, joined Ramon. The duo introduced a new style to their music- a move seen to attract the young generation. Being one of the fathers of modern Norteño music, will the shift away from the Ranchera style bring good tidings?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/91b85ecd263a1701.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mr Blue biography: family, net worth, songs, facts and latest updates</span></p></a><h3>What happened Ramón Ayala?</h3><p class=align-left>Is Ramón Ayala still alive? Yes. Ramon recently celebrated more than 30 years in the music industry. He seemed to have faded from the music scene, with many of his fans reminiscing the glory years of Ramón Ayala y sus Bravos Del Norte. However, even at his advanced age of 70, <a href=# title="Ramon Ayala" rel="nofollow noopener">he still performs</a> at many concerts and shows, albeit with rare mention of upcoming albums.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0155f6ead782ff09.jpg><p class=align-left>Music runs deep in the <a href=#>family</a>. True to this statement, he often makes appearances on stage with his daughter, Yesenia Ayala. Not left behind are Ramon Ayala's grandchildren, including Christopher Ayala, who played the accordion in 2019 alongside his grandfather to a <a href=# title="Ramon Ayala" rel="nofollow noopener">crowd of 75,000</a> in Houston.</p><h3>Ramon Ayala list of songs</h3><p class=align-left>In a span of his long music career, the King of Accordion’ has more than<a href=# title="Ramon Ayala" rel="nofollow noopener"> 110 albums </a>to his name. His devotion to creating Mexican ballads with a mix of passion and talent attracted accolades, earning him four <a href=# title="Ramon Ayala">Grammy Awards</a>. At the height of his stardom, he is projected to have sold more than 750,000 albums annually.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d557e6bf61a93dae.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Juma Nature bio: wife, family, songs, net worth, quick facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The long list of Ramon Ayala songs cannot be exhausted, but these hits deserve some mention:</p><ul><li><i>Tragos Amargos.Rinconcito En El Cielo</i></li><li><i>Un Puño De Tierra</i></li><li><i>Aferrado Por Ti</i></li><li><i>El Disgusto</i></li><li><i>Devolución</i></li><li><i>Mi Tesoro</i></li><li><i>Tengo Miedo</i></li><li><i>Me Caí de la Nube</i></li><li><i>Un Rinconcito En El Cielo</i></li><li><i>Chaparra De Mi Amor.</i></li><li><i>Tragos Amargos.</i></li><li><i>Alma De Lapacho.</i></li><li><i>Arrancame el Corazon</i></li><li><i>Casas de Madera</i></li><li><i>Corrido del Quemador</i></li><li><i>Rama del Mezquite</i></li><li><i>Vas a Ver</i></li><li><i>Ya No Soy el Mismo</i></li></ul><h3>Ramón Ayala's family</h3><p class=align-left>Ayala has been married for more than 35 years and is a father to four children. His wife, Linda Ayala, is a member of the Hidalgo City Council since 2018.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# title="Ramon Ayala" rel="nofollow noopener">Ramon Ayala Jr</a> looks to be the only child who followed his dad's footsteps in music. Apart from being a member of Los Bravos del Norte, he released an album in 1987, followed by several popular singles. On the other hand, daughter, Yesenia Ayala, vied for a seat at Hidalgo School Board and won in the 2012 elections.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/acb2de111be3b094.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Haruna Mubiru biography: wife, family, songs, life story and facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Both Fidencio Ayala and Joe Luis Ayala are members of the Los Bravos del Norte band. Fidencio owns a band, Los Satellites De Fidencio Ayala, where his brother, Jose Luis, performed as a drummer. Unfortunately, José Luis Ayala, presence in the two bands was cut short after <a href=# title="Ramon Ayala" rel="nofollow noopener">succumbing to COVID-19</a> on 30th July 2020.</p><p class=align-left>His demise was a big blow to Ayala, who hailed him as a master of drumming and exceptional performer within the norteña music industry.</p><h3>Is Ramón Ayala Daddy Yankee's father?</h3><p class=align-left>No. The "King of the Accordion" is not the rapper's father. Daddy Yankee, popular reggeton artist and father to <a href=# title="Ramon Ayala">Yamilet Ayala Gonzales</a>, was born in Puerto Rico and son to Ramón Ayala and Rosa Rodriguez. The confusion stems from the similarity in names and his father's affiliation with salsa bands as a drummer.</p><h3>Ramon Ayala house: Where does Ramón Ayala live now?</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0f7a6d5370ec9c44.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bobi Wine bio: Wife, children, parents, net worth, house, facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ayana currently resides in Hidalgo County, Texas, with his family.

It was not clear whether he was performing at the party. Together with other Revelers, he was detained on suspicion of organized crime.</p><p class=align-left>The musician denied any association with the group or knowledge of the identity of the party organizers.

However, he has spent quite a fortune on wheels, having bought the most luxurious brands like BMW, Jaguar, Chevrolet, and Ford.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike musicians who adopt the music styles and cultures of their new surroundings, Ramon Ayala projected the beauty of Spanish music and shaped the fabric of Norteño music.
