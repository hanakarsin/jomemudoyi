They were able to simply walk in for the most part without resistance from authorities or police officers and were able to "take" the structure for several hours.</p><p>It's been reported that the demonstrations were spurred on in part of President Trump's exhortation to his followers that they should "fight" the decision and rally to keep him in the White House. Hundreds who protested Biden's victory went into the Capitol Building and soon were snapping selfies in various offices and chambers, putting MAGA hats and Trump flags on statues and taking photographs.</p><p>The protests ultimately culminated in the deaths of four demonstrators. DC Police Chief Robert Contee said, "One adult female and two adult males appear to have suffered from separate medical emergencies, which resulted in their deaths. Any loss of life in the District is tragic and our thoughts are with anyone impacted by their loss."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Several police officers were also injured in the riots and are currently serving time in the hospital for their injuries. Damage accrued on the Senate building as well: windows were smashed in. The Capitol's security was compromised from around 1 PM EST until approximately 5:40 PM EST. It was the first time it was ever attacked since August 1814, when the British burned it during the War of 1812.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Folks who were watching the protests while glued to their screens and social media channels began noticing that there was a stark difference in the coverage of the events and the imagery of police reactions to the protesters and rioters in the photographs seemed entirely different.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Many photographs from Black Lives Matter protests depict police officers pepper-spraying demonstrators and taking aggressive stances with weaponry and standing their ground.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Whereas the photos from the protests inside the Capitol Building present a much different picture.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>When comparing the protests, it's pretty clear that there's a stark difference in the photographs that emerged from various BLM protests and the storming of the Capitol Building.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Many are highlighting that Anti-Trump protests saw much more violence and carnage than the riots on the Capitol building did.
